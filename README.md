# Task Management API

This project is a **Task Management API** built using **Flask** and **SQLite**. It allows users to manage tasks by creating, updating, deleting, and viewing them with specific due dates and times. The API is integrated with a user-friendly web interface built with **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Due Date and Time Selection**: Users can assign tasks specific due dates and select times.
- **Persistent Database**: All tasks are stored in an **SQLite** database and persist across sessions.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: The frontend is built using **Bootstrap** for a professional and responsive design.
- **API Integration**: Interact with the system via a simple REST API.

## Web Interface for Efficient User Interaction

In addition to the API functionality, this project includes a **responsive web interface** designed to provide a user-friendly experience. The interface allows users to manage tasks visually through an intuitive form and task list, making it more efficient than interacting solely through API calls.

### Key Features of the Web Interface:
- **Task Creation**: Users can easily add new tasks with a form that includes fields for the title, description, due date, and specific time.
- **Task Viewing**: All tasks are displayed in a responsive list, with the due date and time clearly visible.
- **Task Editing**: Users can edit existing tasks directly from the interface. The form is auto-filled with the task's current data for easy modifications.
- **Task Deletion**: Tasks can be quickly deleted with a simple button click, ensuring that outdated or unnecessary tasks are removed without hassle.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is built using **Bootstrap**, ensuring that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
